The U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP) produces a measure of health for where US citizens live by census tract.  The USALEEP project produced estimates of life expectancy at birth—the average number of years a person can expect to live—for most of the census tracts in the United States for the period 2010-2015.
